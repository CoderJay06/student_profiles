Part 1
The first step of the assignment is to fetch data from this public JSON API, and present
the information on the screen. The route to fetch the data is:
method: GET
url: https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/students
You do not need any credentials to access the URL above. It should also have CORS set
up, so you should be able to access the data from the browser.
The goal of this part is to present the data on the screen. Do not worry about styling as
you will be doing that in a future step.

Part 2
The second step of the assignment is to style the web page. Replicate the style of the
image and gif below as best as you can. The font used in the image is Raleway.
Below is a picture of what it should like, and here is a link to a video to show you how
the scrolling should work.

Part 3
In this part, you are going to add a text input, where a user can filter the list of students
by their name (including full name!). Below are a few images of what this should look
like. Here is a video of the filtering in action.

Part 4
In this part, you are going to make each student have an expandable list view, so that all
of their test scores may be viewed. See the images below for what the expanded view
should look like. See the images below for what the view should look like when
expanded. Here is a video as well of what it should look like.
Required: the plus should be an HTML button, and if the button is clicked on, the
expansion will toggle

Part 5
Finally, you will add a text input field to add tags for a specific student. Here is what it
looks like (adding a tag called “new tag”):
You will then add another search bar to search for students based on tags. A strong
submission will have this functionality:
● If a name is entered in the search by name input, and a tag is entered in the
search by tag input, results that include both the name and tag should be shown.
Here is a video of the tag searching in action.
The next page contains an example of filtering by tag and name at the same time as
well as submission instructions.
Submission Details
Please submit your code in a compressed folder on the Hatchways platform. The max
submission size is 5MB.
Upon clicking the submission button, you will see a form as pictured below. We need
this information to be able to test your application.

1. Choose which language and additional technologies you used to develop your
solution. Be sure to select the appropriate version for the language you have
used.

2. Provide us with the install command, the run command, and the port that you
used to run your application.

3. If you cannot find your commands in our suggestions, simply type your own and
select “Use command”.
Please note that these commands will be used to run automated tests, so filling in every
relevant field and providing accurate commands will allow you to receive feedback more
quickly on your submission. If you have any notes to provide about your submission,
please put them in a README, not in the submission form. Additionally, note that the
install and run commands will be run from the root level of your submission, so please
organize your files accordingly.
Do not submit any built folders, since the compressed folder will be too large. Do not
submit your external dependencies (like the node_modules folder), since the
compressed folder will be too large. We will be installing your dependencies before we
run your code.
If your submission is too big and you can't figure out how to compress, you are welcome
to email your solution to hello@hatchways.io. Please include your name, and use the
email you signed up with on the Hatchways platform. Use the subject line “Front-end
Assessment Submission”.
